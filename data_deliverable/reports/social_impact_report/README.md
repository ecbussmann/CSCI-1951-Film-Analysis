# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

### Socio-historical Context ###

#### Societal factors affecting data, predictions, or hypotheses ####
Movie theaters provide the opportunity for people who do not own televisions, computers, or smartphones to have access to media for 9.16 dollars on average (“Ticket Price at North American Movie Theaters 2019”). This inexpensive amount makes movies accessible to many, regardless of device ownership. Owning devices is still a privilege for wealthier Americans. According to Pew Research Center, as of 2019, 29 percent of adults with household incomes below 30,000 dollars do not own a smartphone; 44 percent of these adults do not have home broadband services, 46 percent of these adults do not own a traditional computer, and 66 percent of these adults do not own a tablet (Anderson and Kumar). As a result, not all people who watch a movie have the ability to rate the movie on a rating website, which requires more technologically advanced devices to run. On the other hand, almost 100 percent of adults with household incomes about 100,000 dollars own a smartphone, home broadband service, and a computer (Anderson and Kumar). Thus, people in more privileged income brackets have the ability to rate the movies they watch on rating websites. As a result, the movie ratings might be biased and dominated by wealthier Americans (who own the necessary devices to access the rating websites and share their views). Movie websites, however, do not currently collect demographics based on wealth (IMDB). Therefore, no evidence exists to backup that reviews are skewed by the opinions of wealthier users. Until then, the data should be taken with caution as it might not represent all who watch movies, and we do not want our data to encourage directors to make movies just for the enjoyment of upper-class Americans and ignore the opinions of others.

We do know by evidence, however, that the data is biased in some other ways. People above the age of 45 years old only comprise 12.7 percent of the votes on IMDB, and women only comprise 16.5 percent of the votes on IMDB (Leone). It makes sense that fewer old people rate movies (as only about 42 percent of adults above the age of 65 own smartphones, and only 51 percent of adults above the age of 65 have home broadband) (Anderson and Perrin). The movie going rates of males and females and the device-ownership rates of males and females, however, is similar (“Frequency of Going to the Movies in the U.S. by Gender 2019”). Thus, the exclusion of women in this data is not entirely clear. The disparity does align with other research that suggests 77.8 percent of professional film critics are men (Zauzmer). Either way, knowing that the distribution of users who rate movies is primarily men under 45 is an important discretion for our data analysis. While we want to find out what movie characteristics make movies more likeable and popular to all, our data is skewed in such a way that we are really determining what makes a movie successful among young men. We do not want the opinions of older people and women to be ignored. In the past, the gender gap in movie ratings has been an issue. For example, 78 percent of female critics enjoyed the 2017 movie, “The Zookeeper’s Wife.” Male, critics, however, did not like the film. Since male critics vastly outnumber female critics, the movie did not receive overall positive reviews (only 61 percent of critics overall liked the movie) (Zauzmer). Due to the lack of positive feedback, directors will tend away from making this movie, that women like but men did not. As a result, fewer movies will be made that women like. On the other hand, “The Wolf of Wallstreet” received overall positive reviews, even though many women disliked the movie due to its objectification of female actors (Zauzmer). Thus, directors will continue to make these more vulgar, misogynistic films, believing all like them, even though they primarily appeal to men.

Although we can identify the bias inherent in our data, we can merely give a discretion that our data does not reflect the opinions of all movie watchers. Future research will have to be conducted on what women, senior citizens, and lower-income individuals prefer in movies. Additional research on why so many film critics are men and how to encourage more diversity on film review websites should also be conducted.

#### Stakeholders, audience, and consequences####

The stakeholders of this project are those who watch movies. The goal of our project is to inform directors and producers on what appeals to movie watchers. In that way, films can be produced to the likings of the masses. However, as stated previously, our data is biased, with user ratings dominated by wealthier, younger men. Thus, women, senior citizens, and low-income individuals could potentially be harmed from our research findings. By suggestion that people prefer certain characteristics of a movie, directors will be more inclined to make movies that fulfill those attributes; however, those attributes might primarily only align with the opinions of younger, wealthier men. Therefore, fewer movies will be made to the likings of the groups largely excluded from our data.

The stakeholders of this project are also actors in the film industry. For example, many Hollywood movies pay female leads less. Top female actors make as much as 38% less than male actors (Pedace). As a result of paying women less, these movies might have had a larger budget to divert elsewhere, such as on special effects, that make the movie more popular. Thus, movies that pay women less might be among the most popular movies, which could show production companies that operating under unethical and sexist practices is not an impendor of success. We do not want to encourage directors and producers to underpay actors in order to delegate money elsewhere. We want success to be as ethical as possible. Additionally, films that are received much more positively by women than men are often films with female leads (Zauzmer). Thus, overall, films with female leads appear less popular due to film critics being primarily men. Therefore, the most successful films in our data might be lacking films with female leads due to men liking these less. Again, we do not want to encourage producers to cast fewer women just because our data is skewed towards the liking of men. Already, only 34 percent of speaking roles in films are given to women, and only 28 percent of speaking roles in action films (which may be preferred by men) are given to women (“2019 Statistics”). We do not want to encourage directors to further widen this gender gap in films just because of our skewed data. Therefore, female actors could be harmed from our findings if our findings are not perceived with the discretion that the data is biased towards the views of younger, wealthier men.

#### Topical research on cinema ####

In his 2009 paper, “Cinematic Success Criteria and Their Predictors: The Art and Business of the Film Industry,” Dean Keith Simonton provides a literature review of 91 studies conducted on indicators of success in movies. In summarizing the findings of these studies, Simonton uses critical evaluations, financial performance, and movie awards as the measurements of success. Simonton explains that about 10 percent of mainstream movies released each year are sequels; these sequels tend to have a higher chance of earning money, particularly during the early weeks after the release. Simonton found that the production budget had no correlation with nominations and awards for best picture but has positive correlations with first-weekend and total gross revenue; interestingly, production budget had a negative correlation with critical evaluations. Thus, in summary, “big-budget” movies are appealing to moviegoers but not to critics. The differentiation between what the masses like and what critics like will be interesting to study in our own paper. Simonton also found that R-rated movies are more likely to fail financially and receive fewer nominations and awards; on the other hand, PG-13 movies, which are accessible to a greater portion of the population, are more likely to be profitable. Runtime was found to be positively correlated with critical evaluations, financial performance, and awards and nominations. Therefore, longer movies tend to be more successful. In terms of personnel, Simonton explains that different studies have different definitions of “star” actors, so whether the presence of stars have a positive impact on success varies. Some find that the presence of “star” actors have positive correlation with box office success, while some find that “star” actors have no impact on success; a few studies even find that the appearance of “star” actors have a negative impact on success. With directors and producers, prior box-office success appeared to have a positive effect on future success; however, prior film experience actually had a negative effect on future success. Lastly, composers’ contributions to cinematic success is vague; this topic is interesting because it is not one we are currently studying in our project. Simonton also analyzed how distribution factors (such as season of release, marketing expenditures, market competition, number of screens, and more) and psychological factors (such as the social influence) predicted the success of a movie. These attributes are also ones that we do not currently have data illustration; thus, we are also not studying these characteristics, but it would be interesting to read future studies on this topic (Simonton).

In his literature review, Simonton also analyzed some social factors of the film industry. For example, several studies found that more women get their start as actors younger than men; as they age, women are offered increasingly “unattractive roles if they want to continue in the business.” Men have longer careers as “star” actors. Simonton also explains that exceptional performances by female actors are less likely to appear in outstanding films (as determined by awards). This statement implies that movies that are recognized as successful unfortunately give less focus to women, perhaps due to the domination of men in the population of critics (Simonton).

Lastly, Simonton ends his literature review explaining how these studies should be perceived by society. Simonton explains that cinema as art is not necessarily an indicator of success. For example, drama films are more likely to have aesthetic impact and be perceived well by critics, but drama films are usually less financially lucrative. These pieces might have artistic significance, even though they are not coveted by the public. Thus, while searching for what appeals to the masses, we should not neglect the pieces made for art. While mass appeal is great for finances and businesses, art should not be pushed to the side. Hopefully, these types of studies do not encourage production companies to invest in fewer artistic films. Divesting in art for mainstream media would be a disservice to society (Simonton).

To reference one more study marginally related to our project, we want to bring up the “Thumbs Down” study conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film. This multi-decade long study tracks the representation of women in critical film reviews. As explained earlier, women are largely outnumbered by male critics, with men comprising about 78 percent of all film critics (Erbland). Dr. Martha M. Lauzen, the principal researcher of this study, explained “These gender imbalances matter because they impact the visibility films with female protagonists and women directors receive, as well as the nature of reviews (Erbland). This research expands our understanding of how reviews written by female critics differ from those written by men.” This study recognizes the problems this disparity creates in the representation of women in films and the number of films made for female audiences. This recognition has helped increase the number of female critics (Erbland). This study has also had a societal impact by inspiring producer-director Miranda Bailey to launch a film review website, Cherry Picks, devoted entirely to female critics. As a group wanting to get the most accurate and inclusive data possible, this ongoing study is important to us. Hopefully, through this study and the changes it inspires, future studies will have reviews that better represent the population.

### Ethical Considerations ###

#### Historical/societal biases ####

As discussed above, our data is quite biased due to the distribution of users who use film review sites. In our dataset from IMDB, people above the age of 45 years old only comprise 12.7 percent of the votes on IMDB, and women only comprise 16.5 percent of the votes on IMDB (Leone). While it is unknown exactly why women review movies less than men, this statistics does align with the gender gap for professional film critics (Zauzmer). Additionally, we hypothesize that low-income people are less represented in the dataset due to lower rates of technological ownership in households with income lower than 30,000 dollars (Anderson and Kumar).

Our data might also be biased due to the phenomenon of “volunteer bias.” To be included in the data, a user would have to freely decide to take the time to create an account and write a review. Viewers with neutral feelings towards the movie might decide that this commitment is not worth it; these viewers might not even think about the idea of writing a review. Thus, those most likely to write a review are users with particularly negative or particularly positive feelings towards the movie. This fact means the data might be more skewed in one direction or the other.

In a professional study, one might choose to mitigate the bias by selecting study participants. In this way, the researchers can choose participants who better represent the distribution of people in the United States; they can choose people equally from all income brackets, age groups, genders (including non-binary people who are seemingly not represented in the heteronormative categories of our data), races, nationalities, and more. Additionally, by selecting participants, the researchers can remove the volunteer bias; rather than choosing to write a review, these participants will now have to write a review, regardless of how neutral their feelings are towards the movie.

Since we are not conducting a professional study with the means to pick study participants, we can mitigate some of the bias by calculating adjusted averages. Rather than just calculating averages normally, we can, for example, calculate the average ratings for women and the average ratings for men, and then compute a total average rating by equally weighting the opinions of women and men. Thus, rather than women only making up 16.5 percent of the data, we can weigh female opinions in such a way that women have equal weight. That being said, this system might also have inherent bias since a small portion of women would be representing the opinions of many women.

#### Biases in interpretation ####

Some of our assumptions might create different results than other studies would generate.
Our definition of popular actor, for example, might differ from other studies definitions. In our study, we defined a popular actor as an actor who has been in 10 or more movies that appear in our data set. This assumption is already slightly biased since we do not count the movies not in our data set; additionally, an actor could be popular from television shows rather than movies, but we do not count television appearances. In Dean Keith Simonton’s literature review of studies conducted on the indicators of film success, Simonton explains that the definition of what constitutes a “star” actor differs between studies; as a result, no consensus exists among studies on what effect the presence of a “star” actor plays on the success of a film. Therefore, our definition of a “star” actor and the effect famous actors have on the appeal of a film will most definitely differ from at least some other studies (Simonton).

Additionally, all three group members are female-identifying. As a result, we might deal with the gender disparity in reviews differently than a group of male-identifying students. We might choose to increase the weight given to each review written by a female so that overall averages are equally representative of male and female opinions. A group of all male-identifying students might ignore, or not even notice, this gender disparity. As women, we are especially sensitive to this issue as we all know what it feels like to be left out or have our opinions overshadowed by male opinions. Therefore, our decisions on how to mitigate this bias and alter our data could mean we gain very different results in our data than a different group (with more male influence) analyzing this same data.

#### Potential abuses of results ####

Absolutely our results could be misinterpreted or misused. For example, the goal of our data is to find indicators of success; we want to know what types of movies will appeal to the most people. Production companies, hungry for money, might decide to increasingly only make movies that fulfill the most successful attributes. The attributes mass consumers find appealing, however, differ from what artful critics find appealing in films (Holbrook). It would be a detriment to society for the art of film to be replaced by films all made to make money and fit the same few characterizations. Thus, we hope the desire for film companies to make money by fulfilling the desires of movie consumers does not hinder the creation of artful movies, which may be monetarily less successful. To prevent this lessening of artful films, we should add a discretion about the importance of these creative pieces.

Additionally, we know our data is biased. As discussed above, our data is primarily dominated by male reviewers, younger reviewers, and, most likely, wealthier reviewers. We do not want our criteria of success to just be what these three small groups find appealing. Films should be made for all to enjoy — not just young, wealthy men, who already hold so much power in the world. We do not want filmmakers to use this data to justify making films that only fit the desires of men by pinning these films as more successful. To prevent this misuse, we could try to mitigate bias by changing the weights of reviews so that men and women are equally represented in averages.

Lastly, our data could be misused to justify unethical practices in filmmaking. A film might be classified as successful by our standards but perhaps the movie was made under unethical circumstances. For example, Harvey Weinstein was a Hollywood director who made some of the most popular movies; Weinstein, however, had a history of sexually, mentally, and physically abusing his female actors (Farrow). His female actors were forced to work in unsafe and harmful working conditions. By no means do we want to equate success with these harmful and abusive practices. We do not want to suggest that directors and producers can be abusive and still achieve success with their movies. To prevent this behavior, we can add a disclaimer to our data that this data does include movies made by unethical people, but this data does not support the notion that success can be achieved through unethical behavior.

#### Further ethical considerations ####

We think it is important to ask who is really benefiting from the results. People will find marginal utility from going to the movie theater and enjoying a film; perhaps a few more films are made each year that appeal to people. But the people really benefiting are the major production companies making billions from big-budget films each year. In 2019, Disney made 2.4 billion dollars in profits, Netflix made 2.6 billion dollars in profits, and WarnerMedia made 2.4 billion dollars in profits (Szalai). This hefty income is only rising for these top production companies. In fact, the 2019 profits increase 36 percent for Disney, 63 percent for Netflix, and 14.3 percent for WarnerMedia from 2018 profits (Szalai). Thus, top production companies are already raking in big incomes, with no signs of slowing down. Why conduct studies that inform these large production companies how to make more money by telling them what movies appeal to more people? Why help these companies that are already thriving monetarily — especially when Hollywood has been an industry filled with a lack of diversity (Vary), abusive practices (Moniuszko), poor working conditions for those in lower-tier jobs (Abrams), gender pay gaps (Pedace), offensive messages (Gray), and more. While studying films and what appeals to movie-goers is interesting, the ethics of helping the financial gains of top production companies, who have filled the film industry with harmful practices, is questionable.
